## Outline

* What is web accessibility?
* What I wish I had known sooner
* Message of hope

Note:

I have three and a half points I’m going to touch on today.  One half point will go to my definition of web accessibility, how I regard this work and this cause as I’ve learned and taught about it over the years.  Two more will be about what I wish I’d known sooner; the easy stuff and the hard stuff respectively, and finally it is my wish to leave you all with a message of hope about your interest and work in this field.
